							<h1>Jeremy's Portfolio</h1>
							<p class="major"> Graduating from Oregon State University in June 2026 with a BS in Environmental Sciences and a GIS Certificate. 
								In pursuing the GIS Certificate, I've specialized in processing raster datasets, including: multibeam sonar elevation data, 
								satellite images, and grid-interpolated climate data. I’m seeking a role where I can leverage my GIS expertise 
								and expand on my passion for automating tedious workflows. </p>

							<h2>Education & Experience</h2>
							<p>Oregon State University's GIS Certificate requires seven courses in GIS and remote sensing. In completing the certificate, I've analyzed geospatially data of all kinds including LiDAR data, aerial photography, satellite images, vectors, and more.
								I've leveraged ArcGIS Pro's ModelBuilder and Arcpy to gather data from large raster datasets, I've cleaned and processed multibeam sonar data using MBARI's MB-System and Qimera to suppport ongoing marine geology research, I've run tassled cap transformations
								and used basic machine learning techniques to classify land cover in Google Earth Engine, and have been introduced to: QGIS, Envi software, Potree, Traverse PC, and land survey methods in the field.<br>
								In a summer internship with the Bureau of Land Management (Burns-Steens District) in 2023, I gained experience using Avenza and Field Maps to collect data, and I received certifications in off-road vehicle driving and utility trailer towing.

							<h2>Bathymetry of Active Volcanos</h2>
							<p>Working with Dr. Jeff Beeson and William Chadwick of Oregon State University, I cleaned and processed raw sonar data to create bathymetric maps and then difference grids for two active seamounts in the Mariana Arc (Ahyi and NW Rota-1). <br><br>
								I gained experience with MBARI MB-System, Qimera, and automating workflows in ArcGIS Pro using ModelBuilder and script tools. My contributions have earned me partial authorship in future paper on the region, and a couple of dois for cleaned bathymetry packages. In April, I will be go a 10-day cruise to remap a section of the California Coast.</p>

							<h2>Studying Precipitation in the Historic Record</h2>
							<p>Can we identify flash flood events using only precipitation data? I analyzed 100 years of monthly precipitation data to try doing just that. I used ArcPy scripts to clip and calculate statistics for 1,300 map layers, and organized my data in Excel. It kind of worked!! This was my first venture into using scripts to collect and analyze very large datasets. I am currently refining the workflow using R Studio.</p>

							<h2>Community Outreach Survey - Campus Bathroom Survey</h2>
							<p>For a class project, we were tasked with collecting our own spatial data. We sought public input on campus bathrooms: the good, the bad and the nasty. The project involved Survey123, ArcGIS Online, some Arc Pro and some good old fashioned outreach. The survey received over 250 responses.</p>
